# Relativistic-Thermodynamics

A project to research on relativistic thermodynamics.

After a comprehensive review of this old (yet open) problem, 
I aim to propose new tests and applications of this theory, using modern technologies.
Also, to present a modern theory of Relativistic Thermodynamics can be the final target of this project.
